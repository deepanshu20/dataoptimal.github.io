Hi, my name is Deepanshu sharma and I work  as a freelance data analyst/scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Finance  

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.

During my  freelancer work , I had worked on many project which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.
